# int
a huge int library
# WHOİS
Our general goal is to actually present the low level at a high level and fully integrate all library functions int Python. This library is actually a library of another library's sub-library. With this int library, we want to bring Python and other languages to the same level. Although it is natural that low-level web bases are all separate and all act according to a certain scenario, there is a comfort beyond the basic philosophy and no matter how high the technology is, there is no infrastructure without low-level.If you are going to say that this is crazy, yes, I agree, but it is crazy for a good thing without needing another language or machine format for a low level.You will easily bring the Makine format to your feet with standard language
This may sound ridiculous, but we will do what other languages want and aim to do with standard languages.
